# Python Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating the Python bindings for the C++ features library.

## Examples Overview

### `basic_usage.py`

Demonstrates fundamental usage of each module:

- **Shapes**: Creating circles, rectangles, and squares with analysis
- **Containers**: Type-safe containers with filtering and transformation
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, counting, transforming, and functional chains
- **Memory**: RAII-style resource management with context managers
- **Exceptions**: Result types for safe error handling
- **Timing**: High-resolution timing and benchmarking
- **Random**: Type-safe random number generation with distributions
- **Integration**: Cross-module usage patterns

### `advanced_usage.py`

Shows advanced patterns and real-world use cases:

- **ShapeAnalyzer**: Performance-monitored shape collection analysis
- **DataProcessor**: Complex data processing pipelines with error handling
- **PerformanceBenchmarkSuite**: Comprehensive performance testing
- **Monte Carlo Ï€ Estimation**: Statistical computation example
- **Functional Programming**: Advanced chain operations and pipelines
- **Real-World Simulation**: Virtual environment analysis

## Running the Examples

### Prerequisites

1. Build the C++ library with Python bindings enabled:

   ```bash
   cmake -DBUILD_PYTHON_BINDINGS=ON -B build
   cmake --build build
   ```

2. Ensure the built Python extension is available (typically in `build/binding/`)

3. Install pytest for running tests:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

### Running Examples

```bash
# Run basic usage examples
python python_examples/basic_usage.py

# Run advanced usage examples
python python_examples/advanced_usage.py
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

### Python 3.13 Features

- **Pattern Matching**: Used in factory functions and type dispatch
- **Enhanced Type Hints**: Modern typing with generics and unions
- **Dataclasses**: Immutable data structures for metrics
- **Context Managers**: RAII-like resource management
- **Enum Classes**: Type-safe enumerations

### Modern Python Patterns

- **Functional Programming**: Method chaining and pipeline composition
